Project Title: Semantic Book Recommender

Project Description:
Built a semantic book recommender using OpenAI embeddings, LangChain, and cosine similarity to match user queries with 3,000+ book descriptions.
Enhanced data quality by applying zero-shot classification to categorize books as Fiction or Nonfiction, recovering labels for 1,000+ unlabeled records.
Performed multi-class sentiment analysis on book descriptions using Hugging Face’s distilroberta-base, classifying them into 7 emotion categories.

Technologies Used:
	•	Programming Language: Python
	•	LLM/Embedding API: OpenAI
	•	LangChain – for chaining embedding, vector store, and query operations
	•	Hugging Face Transformers – for zero-shot classification (facebook/bart-large-mnli) and sentiment analysis (emotion-english-distilroberta-base)
	•	scikit-learn / NumPy – for cosine similarity
	•	Data Handling: pandas
